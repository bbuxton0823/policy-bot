## How It Works

Policy Bot leverages advanced AI technologies to create a seamless experience for accessing and understanding policy information. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the system functions:

### 1. Document Processing and Storage

When you upload policy documents to the system, several processes occur:

- **File Upload**: Documents are securely transmitted to the server using encrypted connections.
- **Document Conversion**: The system processes various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and extracts the text content.
- **Chunking**: Large documents are automatically divided into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks for more effective processing.
- **Vector Embedding**: Each document chunk is transformed into a high-dimensional vector representation using OpenAI's embedding models. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text.
- **Vector Storage**: The vectors are stored in a vector database, creating a searchable knowledge base of your policy documents.
- **Metadata Tracking**: The system maintains metadata about each document, including filename, upload date, and document type.
- **Persistence**: Document information is stored in a JSON file (`documents.json`), ensuring your uploaded documents remain available across application restarts.

### 2. Chat Interface and Query Processing

The chat interface is the primary way users interact with policy information:

- **Thread Management**: Each conversation exists within a thread that maintains context and history.
- **Query Analysis**: When a user submits a question, the AI assistant analyzes it to understand the intent and required information.
- **Vector Search**: The system converts the query into a vector and performs a similarity search against the document vectors to find the most relevant information.
- **Context Assembly**: Relevant document chunks are assembled into a context window that the AI can reference.
- **Response Generation**: The AI generates a natural language response based on the relevant policy information.
- **Source Citation**: Each response includes citations to the specific documents and sections where the information was found.
- **Thread Persistence**: Conversations can be saved, named, and retrieved later, allowing users to continue previous discussions.

### 3. Web Search Integration

When enabled, the web search feature enhances responses with current information:

- **Toggle Control**: Users can enable or disable web search with a simple toggle in the interface.
- **Query Reformulation**: The system reformulates the user's question into an effective web search query.
- **API Integration**: The application uses Google's Custom Search API to retrieve relevant web results.
- **Result Processing**: Web search results are processed and filtered for relevance.
- **Information Integration**: The AI seamlessly integrates web information with policy document information in its responses.
- **Source Distinction**: Web sources are clearly distinguished from document sources in the response.

### 4. Visual Content Generation

For data visualization needs, the system can generate charts and graphs:

- **Data Interpretation**: The AI can interpret numerical data mentioned in queries or found in documents.
- **Chart Generation**: Using OpenAI's code interpreter tool, the system can generate visual representations of data.
- **Image Serving**: Generated charts are served through a dedicated image API endpoint.
- **Inline Display**: Charts appear directly in the chat interface for immediate reference.

### 5. User Interface Features

The application includes several UI features for enhanced usability:

- **Tabbed Interface**: Separate tabs for Chat, Document Library, and Upload provide organized access to functionality.
- **Dark Mode**: A system-wide dark mode option reduces eye strain in low-light environments.

- **Visual Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for processes like document uploading, web search status, and message sending.
- **Thread Management**: Tools for saving, loading, and creating new conversation threads.

### 6. Security and Privacy

The application implements several security measures:

- **API Key Protection**: OpenAI and Google API keys are stored securely in environment variables.
- **Document Isolation**: Each organization's documents are isolated in their own vector stores.
- **Local Processing**: Document processing occurs on your server, not shared with third parties.
- **Access Control**: The application can be deployed behind authentication systems for controlled access.

### 7. Technical Architecture

The application uses a modern technical stack:

- **Next.js Framework**: Provides server-side rendering and API routes in a single application.
- **React Components**: Modular UI components for maintainability and reusability.
- **Chakra UI**: A component library that provides accessible, responsive UI elements.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Direct integration with OpenAI's Assistants API, Files API, and Embeddings API.
